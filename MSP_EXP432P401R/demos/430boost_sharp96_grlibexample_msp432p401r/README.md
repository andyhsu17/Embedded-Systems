## Example Summary

This demo software shows how to use the MSP Graphics Library in a project with the Sharp 96x96 display. This demo introduces the functions to configure grlib such as initialization, color inversion, and using foreground and background colors properly.

The Sharp 96x96 display BoosterPack plug-in module does not support touch or color, it is a simple monochrome LCD. It is great for ultra-low power display applications and has a unique mirrored pixel display.

* Pixels
* Lines
* Circles
* Rectangles
* Text
* Images

## Application Design Details
